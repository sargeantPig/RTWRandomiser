;
;  Initial forest definition
;  Only one forest created.  First line should be:
;  forest <offset x>, <offset z>, <cells x>, <cells z>, <cell width>, <cell density>
;  Then LOD distances, as:
;  distances <d0>, <d1>, <d2>, <d3>, <d4>, <d5>
;  Then up to five clip regions to make space for towns:
;  clip <minx clip>, <maxx clip>, <minz clip>, <maxz clip>
;
;  This creates a grid of cells of trees.
;  Each cell can have at most 256 trees, density as 0-1 reduces this.  The clip values allow a region to be masked
;  for the settlement.
;
;  The LOD distances are currently as follows:
;  first level - three billboards
;  second      - two billboards
;  third       - one billboard
;  fourth      - one billboard, position-based angle rather than view direction, higher tolerance angle
;  fifth       - one coloured facet, position-oriented
;  sixth       - (not rendered currently) single point
;
