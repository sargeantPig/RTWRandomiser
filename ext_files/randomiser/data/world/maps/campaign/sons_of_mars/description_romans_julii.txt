The House Of Julii

You are the new leader (pater familias) of a young and upcoming noble (Patrician) family.

You have been given a military command by the Senate and People of Rome (SPQR) and must help forge a safe, strong and lasting empire in Italy.

Your first objectives are to repel a barbarian attack, just near Rome, and then move to take control of the town of Tarquinia, to the north west of Rome.

As a noble Roman it is up to you to "seize the day" (carpe diem).
