The randomiser has many options, some ridiculous but some that really do create enjoyable scenarios. There's also many more more features planned!
 
## Feature Highlights
* Randomised faction rosters - This randomly assigns factions units that it can recruit, you'll never know what the enemy may have in their arsenal.
* Voronoi Empires - Distributes settlements to factions randomly using a voronoi grid.
