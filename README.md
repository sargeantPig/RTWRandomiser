The randomiser has many options, some ridiculous but some that really do create enjoyable scenarios. There's also many more more features planned!

## Feature Highlights
* Randomised faction rosters - This randomly assigns factions units that it can recruit, you'll never know what the enemy may have in their arsenal.
* Voronoi Empires - Distributes settlements to factions randomly using a voronoi grid. 

# Important Information
## Unit Info Fix
The option fixes the unit info page images, instead of defaulting to peasants it will be the correct unit. 
This is a single use fix, you will not have to run the fix twice.
This option **will use around 600mb of disk space** due to how it works. The fix simply copies all the unit_info.tga's and puts them all into each induvidual fation roster.
This option **will open a cmd to apply the fix**, it may take upward to **5-10 mins** depending on your PC.
