# RTWRandomiser
RTWRandomiser aims to randomise all feasible things within the game 'Rome Total War'.

# How to use
Head over to the release page and download the latest release! 

Then just extract all the files from the downloaded archive into the root Rome Total War directory (where the RomeTW.exe is).

The randomiser has many options, some ridiculous but some that really do create enjoyable scenarios. There's also many more more features planned!
 
## Feature Highlights
* Randomised faction rosters - This randomly assigns factions units that it can recruit, you'll never know what the enemy may have in their arsenal.
* Voronoi Empires - Distributes settlements to factions randomly using a voronoi grid. 

# Important Information
## Unit Info Fix
The option fixes the unit info page images, instead of defaulting to peasants it will be the correct unit. 
This is a single use fix, you will not have to run the fix twice.
The fix runs from a .bat file and requires the randomiser to be run as an administrator.
It simply copies all the required unit_info and unit images into an assets folder, and then makes each faction folder a symlink to the assets folder.
