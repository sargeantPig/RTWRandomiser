# RTWRandomiser (Rome Total War Randomiser)
RTWRandomiser aims to randomise all feasible things within the game.

# Randomiser Features so far:

  Random start locations for all factions

  Random costs for every unit (buy cost, upkeep)

  Random stats for each unit (attack, defence)

  Random amount of men in each unit
  
  Random Treasury
  
  Random faction ai
  
  Random Faction Rosters

# Other features:

  view units by faction
  
  view region and corresponding settlement
  
# Known Bugs

  If there's more armies than the amount of cities a faction has they'll stack on the capital. You just need to use the "Army Lists" scroll to move them. I'll prob fix this at some point, but imo its low priority as I'd rather get more things randomised.
  
  Unit cards will default to the peasant card if a faction can't normally recruit it. This is fine however as this does not cause a      crash.


# Installation

Place the .exe, .dll's and randomiser folder into your Main Rome Total War folder (where the RomeTW.exe is located)

Right click the RomeTW.exe and create a shortcut

Right click the newly created shortcut and add this to the end of the target line (no quotes)  " -show_err -mod:randomiser" should look like this "G:\Games\Rome Total war\RomeTW.exe" -show_err -mod:randomiser

Open the randomiser.exe, select the correct folders, then click load to load the initial data.

Now on the randomise tab, select your options and click randomise.

You are now ready to play.
